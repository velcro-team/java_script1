2
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,146
Hello, lads.

3
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,693
Fuck off, old man...

4
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,395
Yeah, you old git.

5
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:15,147
...or I'll smash your head in.

6
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,028
Yeah, give us
your fucking wallet, you cunt.

7
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,531
This lads...

8
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:27,209
is a hurley,
used in the Irish
game of hurling...

9
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,787
a cross between
hockey and murder.

10
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:30,791
You fuck--

11
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:35,509
Why don't l
carve my name
in your fucking face!

12
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,211
Hold on, hold on.

13
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:39,012
Fucking kill him!

14
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,714
Is that
a carpet knife?

15
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:01,201
Jesus wept. I've been looking
for one of these for weeks...

16
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,746
but this carpet
just keeps turning up.

17
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:15,045
A word of advice, girls.

18
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:19,386
If you're picking
the wrong fight...

19
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,721
at least pick
the right weapon.

20
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:21,444
Now, Sergeant, I'd like
you to tell me once again...

21
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,283
about your violent urges.

22
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:28,455
Uh, I must insist
that you extinguish that.

23
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:34,253
And you'll do what,
exactly, if I don't?
Arrest me?

24
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:38,127
I'm not sure you realize
the gravity of your situation.

25
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:42,678
Nice pen.

26
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:43,970
Sergeant?

27
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,797
Nice pen, I said.

28
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,928
Says a lot about you.

29
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,681
Oh, is that so?
Pray tell.

30
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:55,311
You like a solid phallic
symbol between your fingers.

31
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,986
Sergeant Brant,
in the last year...

32
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:02,606
you've been
charged with bugging
the Superintendent's office...

33
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,317
beating a felon unconscious
in a billiards hall...

34
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:09,246
and just last week
you assaulted three
innocent youths...

35
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,574
with a hockey stick.
Shall I go on?

36
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:17,163
My report will be a
major factor in whether
you remain in the force.

37
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,507
Ser-- Sergeant Brant,
sit down.

38
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,928
The thing is, Doc...

39
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:38,768
this is the only work l
can do, and if I get bounced...

40
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,358
I'm sure I'll do
something truly reckless.

41
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,783
Hi.

42
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,716
You got a
minute for me?

43
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:10,015
Yeah. What is it?

44
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,301
I don't know.

45
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:16,806
I thought two years
undercover on the Drug Squad
would help me out, but...

46
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,391
I don't know.

47
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:22,770
I thought maybe my past
went against me or...

48
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:26,065
I failed the
Sergeant’s exam.

49
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,820
Everyone fails
the first time.

50
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,448
Did you?

51
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:35,370
Now you've only
been out of rehab a few
months. Give it time.

52
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:39,211
Falls, go grab
some piss poor tea
in the canteen, okay?

53
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,719
You don't wanna
believe what you read
in the papers, sir.

54
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,051
It's not
what this station
needs right now.

55
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:57,603
You know we can't afford
any more bad publicity.

56
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:04,148
Imagine you walk
down the street...

57
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:07,606
and you bump into
three blokes carrying
carpeting knives.

58
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,819
Nah, they're not
carpet fitters.
They're after your wallet.

59
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,824
Maybe even that gold watch...

60
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:17,032
that you got for the highest
arrest rate in the Southeast.

61
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:21,502
One of the rats there even
very kindly offered to carve
their name in your face.

62
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:25,374
Now, would you be more
worried about whether
you're gonna have a fight...

63
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,048
than how it looks in the papers?

64
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:34,634
Well, just keep a
low profile until this
little shit storm blows over.

65
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,991
Business is brisk.

66
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,907
Have that, Daniel.

67
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:02,836
I don't think I can
go through with this.

68
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:06,381
You'll be okay.
It'll be over
in no time.

69
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,215
You think I should've
gone for a burial?

70
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,168
No.

71
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:15,056
You'll be glad.

72
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,351
We're ready for you,
Inspector Roberts.

73
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,929
Go on.

74
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,610
Who got
the flowers?

75
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,904
Owner of a stall
in Streatham owed
me a favor.

76
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,232
Does a clean line
in fruit and veg.

77
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,989
It's time.

78
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,993
Got some last words, Gov?

79
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:09,695
We'll miss you, love.

80
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:16,651
Coats and Hammond,
as quick as you can.

81
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,991
Let's get you legless.

82
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,006
Where's Fiona?

83
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,337
What?

84
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,764
The urn, Brant.

85
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,217
Where the fuck's the urn?

86
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,682
Someone must've
nicked that.

87
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,572
One of these guys.

88
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,790
Up, up and away.

89
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,952
We need a detective.

90
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,558
All right.

91
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,410
Fuck you, pig.

92
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,509
Brant, are you there?

93
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,635
Brant!

94
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,762
What?

95
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,219
We need you down at
Smithfield yesterday, Brant.

96
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,225
An officer is down.
All hands to the pump...

97
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,432
and don 't go talking
to any fucking journalists.

98
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,058
Sir?

99
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:15,020
I'm throwing you
a bone, Brant!

100
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,531
The officer
is Sandra Bates--

101
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,700
O h, no. It can't be.

102
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:24,822
The assailant
is armed and dangerous--

103
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,334
That is some dress.

104
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,211
Yeah, well you
look shitty.

105
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:39,219
I've been consoling the
Inspector. His wife passed.

106
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,341
Yeah. I heard.

107
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:46,222
I knew Sandra.
We were at Police
College together.

108
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,519
Brant.

109
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,187
Was there something?

110
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,765
Sir? There's a witness.

111
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,818
What? Why
wasn't I told?

112
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,816
I've been trying to tell you
for the past half an hour.

113
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,398
Take his statement.

114
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:12,369
The dead policewoman
has been identified as...

115
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:16,043
as 26-year-old
Sandra Bates of Camberwell.

116
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,546
Described as a credit
to her force...

117
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,922
she was shot
at point blank range...

118
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,800
and died instantly.

119
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,223
And now from our
Washington correspondent--

120
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,311
It's Tony, right?

121
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,104
Anthony.
You're Brant, right?

122
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,932
You know me?

123
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,734
Who doesn’t? Last year
at Camberwell billiards...

124
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:40,109
when that nutter
come in with a crowbar,
attacked a couple of mates?

125
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,906
You rocked up,
beat matey to a pulp.

126
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,403
That makes me think
you're a legend.

127
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,323
I'm flattered.
They got names?

128
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,746
That's Posh.
That's Becks.

129
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,073
Posh and fucking Becks?

130
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,409
You're fucking right.

131
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,582
So run the description
by me again.

132
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,085
Ain't you gonna
take any notes?

133
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:01,760
Do I look
like I carry a pencil?

134
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,697
Morning. I'm
Porter Nash.

135
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:27,574
Superintendent Brown
said to talk to you
about getting a locker.

136
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,891
Due to the recent
death of his wife...

137
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,773
Chief Inspector Roberts
is on extended leave.

138
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,780
I'm therefore promoting
Sergeant Porter Nash...

139
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,948
to Acting Inspector...

140
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,195
and temporary head
of the inquiry.

141
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,618
Sir?

142
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,445
Yes?

143
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,997
Shouldn't we promote
one of our own?

144
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,996
Now, now gents.
I don 't need
to remind you...

145
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,624
that we're already
the focus of a media circus.

146
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:22,840
Sergeant Nash comes to us
from the prestigious
West London branch...

147
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:26,920
and it is my opinion that
he will instill a level
of professionalism...

148
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:30,382
hitherto lacking
in our primitive
Southeast Division.

149
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:58,038
I'm coming in.

150
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:02,088
You look like shit.

151
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,257
Take that hood
off your head.

152
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,925
I'm in trouble.

153
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,173
You got
any beers
or anything?

154
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,925
You know I haven't.

155
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,972
Sit down.

156
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,846
Talk.

157
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,348
Well, me, Macky and Bowes were

158
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:21,354
What? Looking for a madness?

159
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,776
I think we killed someone.

160
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,607
Some camel jockey.

161
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,314
Sorry, I mean
an Indian guy.

162
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,401
He weren't moving.

163
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,990
Okay.

164
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,996
Okay, I'll look into it.

165
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,577
Thank you--

166
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,378
Shut up.
I ain't finished yet.

167
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:46,170
If he's dead,
you're on your own.

168
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,219
Yeah? In fact, I’ll
come round your yard
and nick you myself.

169
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:54,345
Now you go home
and you wait till
you hear from me.

170
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,262
It's choice time, John.
If he lives...

171
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:03,020
you either quit that gang
or you quit coming round
here, you understand?

172
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,066
Yeah.

173
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,393
Yeah, what?

174
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:10,320
Yes, ma'am.

175
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,953
Brant, can l
have a word?

176
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,828
I just need to
have a quick chat.

177
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,963
So what can l
do for you?

178
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:30,384
I need a favor.

179
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:35,598
A friend of mine is in trouble.
I need to get him off the hook.

180
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,141
Someone you're riding?

181
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:40,937
What?
No, nothing like that.

182
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,098
He's a kid.

183
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,683
There's a DI.
I used to know him
from way back.

184
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,190
We shared a snitch in Brixton.
He'll be able to help.

185
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,361
Name?

186
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,316
Stokes. Craig Stokes.

187
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,741
Thank you.

188
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,989
Now you owe me one.

189
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,213
Harold Dunlop.

190
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,666
I read your stuff
in the papers.

191
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,251
I've got some information
on the police killings.

192
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,678
All rig ht.
Hang on.

193
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,312
All right. Fire away.

194
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,310
Aw, have some
fucking manners.

195
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,643
I'm offering you information.
You don't even say hello.

196
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,979
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance.
Is that better?

197
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,189
I detest sarcasm.

198
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:38,195
Maybe I'll start
on journalists when
I've finished my cop quota.

199
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,244
Oh, uh, heh...

200
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,041
Listen fellow.

201
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,494
You and me got off to
the wrong start, didn't we?

202
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,204
So let's try again now.

203
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,085
What's your name?

204
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,417
Oh, Christ. I'm not sure
you're even up to the task.

205
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,134
What task?

206
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,389
Reporting from inside
the police killings?

207
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:04,805
Where are you on
the food chain?
You got any clout?

208
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:08,399
Well, I'm a staff writer
in the crime department, yeah.

209
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:12,771
I can make you famous.

210
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,652
Yo there, copper!
Remember me?

211
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,656
Do you want something?

212
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,612
Thing.

213
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,243
What?

214
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,116
It's 'something'
not somethink.'

215
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,698
You should at least
be able to speak properly.

216
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,499
Look, get lost mate, yeah?

217
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,202
I've got a question, yeah?
What would you do...

218
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,130
if I was
to call you a cunt?

219
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:34,129
Which do you prefer?
Seven or eight?

220
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,676
Eight.

221
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,628
Eight it is.

222
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,509
Hang on. What?
Eight what?

223
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,052
Eight more coppers
to kill. Bye.

224
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,102
What--

225
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,596
Cup of tea
and a biscuit.

226
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,773
Are you as black
as you're painted?

227
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,226
Are you as Nancy
as they say?

228
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,354
Thing is, Brant,
if there's a problem,
I'm gonna need to know about it.

229
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,360
There's a problem, all right.

230
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,158
Some sick fuck
is killing policemen...

231
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,702
and he's only just started.

232
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,495
I meant between us.

233
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,199
I know what you meant.

234
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:53,501
Problem?
Not unless you
follow me into public toilets.

235
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:57,379
So I don't get to be
head boy. Big fucking deal.

236
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,502
Less paperwork for me.

237
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,264
There's nothing, sir.

238
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,757
See if you
can get me a possible
match of the bullet.

239
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,308
Yes, sir.

240
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,397
Just keep it open
for me, for now.

241
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:16,189
Move your right and take your
fucking left hand up and over.

242
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,694
Aw, fuck me.
Not you again, mate.

243
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,532
I'll keep coming back
until you get me
a knife.

244
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,201
Keep your
right hand up.
I keep telling ya.

245
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,903
You're getting
caught with your
left up.

246
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,410
No, that's not him.

247
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:34,329
Yeah, please.
That's quite important.

248
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,418
Want me to widen
the area for questioning?

249
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,632
Great, yeah.
Great idea.

250
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,334
The gun was a
9mm semi-automatic.

251
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,169
A SIG or a Glock?

252
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,925
I'll go on
to forensics now.

253
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,222
No?

254
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,674
I don't fucking know.

255
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,100
I don't know!

256
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,973
I wanna know
the name

257
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,975
of every punk
that you sold

258
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,352
a 9 mil semi-automatic
pistol to in the last
few months.

259
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,525
He's got his back
turned every time.

260
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,978
He knows where
the cameras are.

261
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:00,188
Don't make me
come back

262
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,692
and give me
the same

263
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,323
fucking silly
answers, all right?

264
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,618
I'll ring
you when I've
got something.

265
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,912
I want the name, address
and fucking postal code.

266
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,489
Sarge, come have
a look at this?

267
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:14,793
We've got no
footage of the killing
of the second officer.

268
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,745
There must be more.
Keep looking.

269
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,047
Sir.

270
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,850
You know what I want...

271
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,929
so spill.

272
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,849
Well, I need paying first.

273
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,446
What do you have in mind?

274
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,531
Serious.

275
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,654
Serious money.

276
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,077
Serious money?

277
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,654
Mmm-hmm.

278
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,331
What, like the time
of benefit?

279
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,203
Yeah.

280
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,537
Bony fucker, aren't ya?

281
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:02,841
You don't have the brains
of a chicken, do you?

282
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:09,549
I doubt you have any real
Irish blood in you, Radnor.

283
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:13,932
Me, I'm a wild streak
and a Celt.
Makes me unpredictable.

284
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,893
Them Irish. Did you know
they invented kneecap?

285
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,316
It's a nasty business.

286
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,769
They fix you up
as best they can...

287
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:25,607
but you'll
always have a limp.
How does that sound?

288
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:30,320
Radnor the gimp.
How does that go down
in your retirement package?

289
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:37,827
A brandy here, Paul.
And a large scotch.

290
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,753
Here's what we'll do.

291
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:49,589
We'll have a nice stiff drink.
Ought to fire us off.

292
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,928
Well, go on, Rad.
Pay the man.

293
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,723
Well, l-- I don't
drink brandy.

294
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,439
Yeah, keep
the change.

295
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,989
Okay, tell me.

296
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,408
There's this bloke
at the Peacock Gym.

297
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:20,119
He set fire
to a police dog.

298
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:23,377
YouTubed it.
Somebody asked him
why he did it. He said...

299
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:27,343
"Practice."

300
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,919
Well, that's it?

301
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,925
Seriously, he's a nutter.

302
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,927
Fuck, if we pulled in
every wanker who said that...

303
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,599
we'd be up to our
arse in suspects.

304
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,143
What's his name?

305
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,095
Well, I don't--
I don't-- I don't know.

306
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,852
But I'm meeting a guy
later who's gonna
get it for me.

307
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:44,231
Don't bother.
I'll go to the gym.
Ask the manager.

308
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:48,439
But you see, l--
Don't I get something?

309
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:52,535
I left you the rest of my
crisps, you greedy bugger.

310
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,992
What more do you want?

311
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,198
For fuck's sake.

312
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:59,500
Are you fucking me?

313
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:03,250
Can I have
my change back, please?

314
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,252
Fuck, I can't walk.

315
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,852
Are you as black
as you're painted?

316
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:27,167
Disturbing you,
am l?

317
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,873
No, I was just
in the middle
of eating.

318
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:33,632
Go ahead.
That's your Tex Mex, isn't it?

319
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,050
Christ, what is that?

320
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,057
Hare Krishna food?

321
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,854
Better put some
meat in you, boy.

322
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,063
A big juicy steak.
Get the blood flowing.

323
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,065
You know,
the chaps had a word...

324
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,114
for this type of
bare look, didn't they?

325
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,567
Minimalist.

326
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,612
Shy is the word
I had in mind.

327
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:01,618
Can I get a drink, then?

328
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:04,826
Over there.
Help yourself.

329
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:10,214
Jesus, no wonder you
stay at home.

330
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,541
So what are you having?

331
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,719
I've got some
water, thanks.

332
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:20,391
Can I ask you
why you're here?

333
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:24,011
I need your advice.

334
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:28,566
Look, I don't give
a fuck about you
being a pillow biter.

335
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,813
I don't give a fuck
what people do...

336
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,737
as long as they
keep it to themselves.

337
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:39,535
I respect you
and there's not many I do.

338
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,322
What's the problem?

339
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,376
I'm losing it.

340
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,587
In what way?

341
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,344
I'm blacking out.

342
00:25:57,431 --> 00:26:02,050
Not often, but enough
to be worried.

343
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:07,142
Don't wanna talk, eat.

344
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,941
It's actually a huge effort
to drag myself outta bed.

345
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:17,611
I just stare at the wall.

346
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:20,901
Just do nothing, you know?

347
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,078
Absolutely nothing.

348
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,030
It's burnout.

349
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,331
What?

350
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,534
Your brain's on meltdown.

351
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:30,210
A couple of days
doing nothing...

352
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,878
and you’ll
start to come back.

353
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,956
You sound pretty sure.

354
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:36,212
Yeah, I am sure.
I've been there myself.

355
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,377
You?

356
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,880
Yeah. I could barely
work the microwave.

357
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,056
I was fucked.

358
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:46,226
We got this pedophile
on the loose in Holland Park.

359
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:49,055
He was luring
children into his car.

360
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:52,391
We knew who he was
but we just couldn't
catch him in the act.

361
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:56,521
These kids were too
traumatized to identify him.

362
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,776
He was this big
showbiz agent, you know.

363
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,279
Major connections.

364
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,076
The guys back
at the nick...

365
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,949
they just about put me
on a par with him...

366
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,905
because I was
a queer, yeah?

367
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,332
Wanked off into condoms
and leave them
in my locker...

368
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,661
scratched the car,
sugar in the petrol tank.

369
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,371
All the usual shit.

370
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:17,591
It put me
under tremendous pressure.

371
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:20,545
I was knocking back
Valium, shots at breakfast...

372
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,220
two packs a day.

373
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,889
So I thought, fuck it.

374
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:28,094
I thought I'd take matters
into my own hands.

375
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,892
And I broke
into the pedophile's
house at 4:00 in the morning...

376
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,725
and I smashed his bollocks
in with a baseball bat...

377
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:36,811
until they fucking popped.

378
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,770
I took a leave
of absence after that.

379
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,572
I was burnt out.

380
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,025
Came back here,
I shut the curtains.

381
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,205
Pulled the phone out.
Just hid away.

382
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:51,876
I went back to work
expecting the axe...

383
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:55,580
but they ended up
transferring me.

384
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:04,968
Wanker.

385
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:26,868
Morning.
Want some breakfast?

386
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,992
A coffee,
two sugars.

387
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,838
You had an affair
with me?

388
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:41,087
I held back.

389
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:44,215
So any idea who
we're looking for?

390
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:48,094
A psycho.
Whistles while he works.

391
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:50,016
Showed up
at Peacock Gym yesterday.

392
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,599
I got the name
of a bloke in Nunhead.

393
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,929
Worth a visit?

394
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,643
You want me along?

395
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,770
Sure. See you there
in half an hour.

396
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:07,826
Oh, yeah. The other thing,
about you being a good cop.
I meant that.

397
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:10,074
Thank you.

398
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,498
For a poofter.

399
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,194
You replaced me.

400
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,405
You're on compassionate leave.

401
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,452
I 'm back.

402
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:58,582
Inspector Roberts,
losing a wife
is not easy.

403
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,082
You lost your wife?

404
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,834
Well, no--

405
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:04,007
How would you feel
about early retirement?

406
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:06,756
We'd miss you, sir.

407
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,803
You know who
else would miss you?

408
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:13,930
Olga, the 250-pound
call girl you see
every Wednesday.

409
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:16,387
Your wife thinks
you're playing squash.

410
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:20,107
Well, you are, in a way.

411
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:24,152
I don't need a fanfare.
I don't need an office.

412
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,820
I just wanna work.

413
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,568
Well, what are
you waiting for?

414
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,240
Fuck off, Roberts.

415
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:31,990
Go solve some crimes.

416
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:50,880
Fuck.

417
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:55,680
Police! Open up!

418
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,272
Uh.

419
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:07,230
Oh!

420
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,326
Barry Weiss?

421
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,041
That is me.

422
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,417
Can we come in?

423
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,506
Got a warrant?

424
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:30,927
It's in the post.

425
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,026
Can I get you anything?

426
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:58,364
How about a cuppa, coppers?

427
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,414
I know you.

428
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:02,993
If we'd met,
I'm sure I'd remember.

429
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,926
You know what that is?

430
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:19,430
Michael Jackson's shit.

431
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:21,770
It's priceless.

432
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,893
I got it off eBay.

433
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:26,942
So what was it you
were looking for?
Maybe I could help you.

434
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,939
What do you do, Mr. Weiss?

435
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:32,113
I'm between jobs.

436
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,739
You like torching
dogs, do ya?

437
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,821
I saw your
home movie.

438
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,076
On YouTube, right?

439
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:43,910
It got over 9,000
hits before they
took it down.

440
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:46,837
I post--
I posted it, yeah,
but I wasn't involved.

441
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,289
Nah, I'm joking.
I love animals, me.

442
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:52,251
What about police, Barry?
You like them?

443
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,927
"Thank God," I say.

444
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:59,179
I say "Thank God
for the men in blue."

445
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:03,729
I remember you now, Barry.

446
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:07,103
Yeah, you're
the piece of shit
from the billiards hall.

447
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:15,069
Back on your feet,
I see.

448
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:20,992
Come on, Nash.
Let's get out of here.

449
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:32,382
What was
all that about?

450
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:35,048
I had a run in with
him about a year ago.

451
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,049
I might have put
him in the hospital.

452
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,256
Welcome to the liberal
Southeast.

453
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:41,558
It gets results.

454
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:43,852
Let's just keep
an eye on him.

455
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:46,555
You just wait and see.

456
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,766
Yeah?

457
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,441
You wait and see.

458
00:33:56,785 --> 00:34:00,528
What are you
fucking looking at,
you fucking perv?

459
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:10,893
Fuck. Ow!

460
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:18,279
Weiss. Nice.

461
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:28,369
B. Weiss, P-23...

462
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:32,874
Weymouth Parking.
You little bastard.

463
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:12,185
Who is it?

464
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:14,888
Satellite TV.

465
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:17,144
I've come for your box.

466
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,615
What's the problem?
I just paid the bill.

467
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,823
[Chuckles}
That's funny...

468
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,574
because you
are the bill.

469
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,280
You're not
the usual bloke--

470
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,662
Ugh.

471
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,026
Ah!

472
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,741
Ah!

473
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:39,731
Question two. Which Scottish
music hall comedian--

474
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,354
B! B! B.

475
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,150
A. Jack Milroy

476
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:46,150
B. Andy Stewart
or C. Sir Harry Lauder?

477
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:49,074
B.

478
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,574
Come on, you fucking idiot, B.
[Chuckles}

479
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,721
Yes.

480
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,182
Sweet.

481
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,843
There 's a fire
at Cerinem Point.

482
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:55,048
In a flat on the 1 6th
floor, you'll find
cop number three.

483
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:57,680
Oh, I used a new system.

484
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,135
A new system?

485
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,596
Can you be
a bit clearer?

486
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:03,682
I pulverized
the fucker with a hammer.

487
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:07,064
Is that clear
enough for you?

488
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,864
I pulverized
the fucker with a hammer.

489
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,236
Oh, yeah.

490
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:15,694
Oh, shit.

491
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,528
Yeah, I forgot.
I got a name.

492
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:19,740
A name?

493
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,950
Is there an echo?
Stop repeating
everything I say.

494
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:23,285
It's getting
on my fucking tits.

495
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:24,744
I'm sorry.

496
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:28,673
It's "Blitz"
as in "Blitzkrieg."

497
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,341
You got that?

498
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,295
Yeah. That's good. Yeah.

499
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,927
Oh, fuck.

500
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:21,346
Sarge, you need
to see this.

501
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,803
It's the evening edition.

502
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:29,309
Bastards!

503
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:35,940
Where the hell
have you been?

504
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,400
Can't say.

505
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,619
What do you mean
you can't say?

506
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:41,412
Can't account
for my movements?

507
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,122
Is that
the correct lingo?

508
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:45,575
You do know another
policeman’s been killed?

509
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,080
Chief Inspector Roberts.

510
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,207
What?

511
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,835
The killer's targets
are in this station.

512
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,713
He used a hammer
to kill Roberts
and he torched his flat.

513
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:56,920
He contacted some hack
journalist at The Post...

514
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:59,973
called Dunlop.
Gave him all
the details.

515
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,924
Dunlop you say?

516
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,056
Yeah. Harold Dunlop.
I sent a team over there...

517
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:06,354
to tap his phone and make
sure his calls are traced.

518
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:07,601
Do you know him?

519
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,273
I do.

520
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,895
I'm Harold Dunlop
from The Post.

521
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,855
Hey! Get off!

522
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:19,113
All right! All right!
Bloody hell!

523
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,409
What was
all that about?

524
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,403
I told you,
I know him.

525
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,077
Bastard put my
picture in the paper.

526
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,328
Click.

527
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,635
Hello. Hello. Hello.

528
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,135
Bang. Bang.

529
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:34,692
Yippity-doo-dah-day.

530
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,072
Hello? Dunlop.

531
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:46,870
Is this Harold Dunlop?

532
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,619
Yeah. Yeah.

533
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,665
The Harold Dunlop?
The crime reporter?

534
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:51,742
Can you get me a lattè?

535
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:53,749
Yeah. Who's this?

536
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,424
Mr. Dunlop, how would
you like to nail The Blitz?

537
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:59,793
Yeah, I 'd like
that very much.

538
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:04,548
Oh-ho! Is that it?
Perhaps I didn't make
myself clear, Mr. Dunlop.

539
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,758
I know the name
of the cop killer.

540
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:10,345
I think you're gonna
have to work a little bit
harder than that.

541
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,805
It'll be an honor to bring
that maniac to justice.

542
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,265
Yeah. Yeah.

543
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,271
Well, you'll have
a little think...

544
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,694
about how much
you'd be willing to pay.

545
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:21,025
Come now, Mr. Dunlop.

546
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:24,655
You didn't think this was
a citizen doing his bit
now, did you?

547
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:25,905
How much do you want?

548
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:28,033
50k. In cash.

549
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:31,241
For that, you get
the name of The Blitz...

550
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,166
plus extras.

551
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:35,040
Extras?
What do you mean extras?

552
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:37,588
Various assorted
items, Mr. Dunlop.

553
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:41,088
You'll find out
when I get my 50k.

554
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,967
I'm the master
of the fucking universe.

555
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:56,978
Hello.

556
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,355
Hey.

557
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:04,737
The fire pretty much
destroyed anything
around the body.

558
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:08,361
We found that in the bathroom.
The fire wasn't
so bad in there.

559
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:11,702
But did the heat or water
damage any DNA
or fingerprints?

560
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,578
I'm afraid so.

561
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:20,297
Peacock Gym.

562
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:23,091
Yeah, looks like it.

563
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:27,555
It's B rant.
Check if DI Roberts
was ever a member
of the Peacock Gym.

564
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,021
What are you doing?

565
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:38,144
I told you to wait
until you heard
from me.

566
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:40,022
Yeah, well,
I didn't hear from you.

567
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,773
Yeah.
Well, I'm sorting it.

568
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,404
Yeah? I'm trying to.

569
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:46,740
Look, just go home.

570
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,839
DI Stokes?

571
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,344
You must be Falls.

572
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,800
Yeah. Yeah.

573
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,305
What'll you have?

574
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:17,605
Tea, please, sir.
Just tea.

575
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:20,399
Forget the "sir" stuff.
Craig'll do.

576
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:21,859
Tea and toast
for two!

577
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:23,732
Coming up, love!

578
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:26,360
Okay. Well, we've got
two of the kids...

579
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,361
involved in the assault
of Mr. Azziz.

580
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:29,612
I thought-- He's not--?

581
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:32,537
Dead? Incredibly, no.

582
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,205
Let me see.

583
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:38,160
John Wells,
known as Metal.

584
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:40,586
This the one
you wanted to discuss?

585
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:41,753
Yes.

586
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:43,923
What is he? A snitch?

587
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,966
Yeah, well, you know...

588
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:49,637
and I try to look out
for him.

589
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:52,807
Thank you.

590
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:55,760
He's a piece of shit.

591
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:56,844
A thug.

592
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,679
Oh, he's a boy.

593
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:02,642
Underneath all that,
he's just a scared boy.

594
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:08,651
So is there
anything you can do?

595
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:11,234
Anything can be buried.

596
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:14,321
Will you?

597
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:17,327
Meet me for a drink tonight.

598
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,542
That's all?

599
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:33,760
Hey, Roberts and
the Peacock Gym.
Never a member.

600
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:36,058
No, of course not.

601
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:37,760
Have you got a minute?

602
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,061
Yeah.

603
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:41,059
Can you work that thing?

604
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:43,186
Brant, you're
such a dinosaur.

605
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:46,986
I'm surprised you can even
work your own microwave.

606
00:47:47,073 --> 00:47:49,985
This is
women's work.
Just like typing.

607
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:51,816
Right.

608
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:53,572
So what are
you looking for?

609
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:56,579
Barry Weiss.
It's the Belfront Towers.

610
00:47:56,665 --> 00:48:02,126
Kicked out of Peacock Gym.

611
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:05,876
Oh, wow. This guy's
always in trouble.

612
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:10,630
He's been arrested more times
than you've had WPC's.

613
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,177
You know I'm
not like that.

614
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,095
Right.

615
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:17,926
It's petty stuff, though.
What do you think?

616
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,557
No, nothing major.

617
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:21,888
None of that yet.

618
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,019
Have you got my money?

619
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:31,356
Yeah. I just had to
pull a few strings.

620
00:48:31,534 --> 00:48:35,447
Pick me up outside
Weymouth Street car park.

621
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,541
Stand there.

622
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:51,716
All right.

623
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:54,261
There. Steady. There.

624
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,714
Oh, Jesus.

625
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:10,694
Click.

626
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:22,157
These are the extras
I was talking about.

627
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:25,414
Trophies, I believe
is the correct term.

628
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,745
And you know
who these belong to, eh?

629
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,297
Correct.

630
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,885
Right, I showed
you mine.

631
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,760
Perhaps we could
have a little look
at yours now.

632
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,744
All right.

633
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,624
Aw.

634
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:10,921
What?

635
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,248
That's not
fifty grand.

636
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:13,791
Of course
it's fifty grand.

637
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:15,251
There's no way
that's fifty grand.

638
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:16,836
When did you
last see fifty grand?

639
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:18,592
Don't you trust me?
Go and count it.

640
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,762
It's about
500 quid.

641
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,181
Oh. Go on, then.

642
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,930
I'm gonna count
every bit of it.

643
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,516
Good. Buy yourself
a new suit.

644
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:34,688
Fifty, fifty,
fifty, fifty, fifty.

645
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:39,734
You are a fucking genius.

646
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:52,292
I haven't told him
your name yet.

647
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:55,378
Relax. I'm not
gonna hurt you.

648
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:59,925
I only do police. Remember?

649
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:02,131
How'd you get on to me?

650
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:07,516
I got your address
from the Peacock Gym...

651
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:11,645
and I went
through your rubbish.

652
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,977
I found the receipt
for the parking garage.

653
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,858
That's very impressive.

654
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:20,066
I haven't told him
your name yet.

655
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,283
I haven't
told him your name.

656
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:27,990
But you're gonna
have to help me
out, see?

657
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,621
Ah.

658
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:32,624
I haven't told him
your name yet.

659
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:34,922
This is a bit
of a tight squeeze.

660
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:40,214
I haven't told him
your name yet.

661
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:41,796
No, no, no.

662
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:25,423
A double Irish.

663
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,221
Can't do, buddy.
I'm closed.

664
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:35,767
Listen up. I'm only
gonna say this once.
I ain't your 'buddy.'

665
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:39,027
When I ask
for a drink, you say,
"Ice with that, sir?"

666
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:41,651
Now let's begin again.
A double Irish.

667
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,324
You want ice
with that, sir?

668
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:51,498
Don't be ridiculous.
Who needs ice?

669
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:57,838
That’ll be five quid, sir.

670
00:52:57,925 --> 00:52:59,790
Like you said...

671
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:02,501
you're closed.

672
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:06,096
He went to the toilet.
When he hadn't come back...

673
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,096
I got concerned.
I thought he fell in.

674
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:08,382
He did.

675
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:10,134
Then what happened?

676
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:12,720
Well, I went in there,
didn't l? I found him.

677
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:16,098
Well, you didn't
exactly come rushing out
though, did you, Mr. Dunlop?

678
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,809
The man at the bar says
you was with him
for ten minutes.

679
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:21,611
Had you down as a couple
of George Michael fans.

680
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:23,564
Hey, I was looking
for the money.

681
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:25,069
Money?

682
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,696
The paper's money.

683
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:27,993
We were paying him
for an exclusive.

684
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,116
Oh, for fuck's sake.

685
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,617
Can I remind you
that people...

686
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:32,573
are being killed
here, Mr. Dunlop?

687
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:34,499
Ah, yeah?

688
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:37,043
Yeah. Human beings,
with families and children.

689
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:39,838
There's a car. Yeah.
Oh, God, I forgot.

690
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:43,133
Yeah. A car.
You're not gonna
believe what's inside.

691
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,085
Where is this car?

692
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,592
Weymouth Street car park.
It's a black Jaguar.

693
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:48,843
Bay 23!

694
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:55,020
Oy! Am I gonna get
police protection?

695
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:56,643
Oh, yeah.

696
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:59,726
We'll be all over you.

697
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,357
Should've been
the other guy
had him killed.

698
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:13,580
What now?

699
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:24,049
Murder inquiry.
I want the disc
for the last month.

700
00:54:24,136 --> 00:54:25,421
Discs are full.

701
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:27,294
What do you mean
they’re full?

702
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,926
They haven't recorded
anything for six weeks.

703
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:32,133
It ran out of memory.
They'll fix it Monday.

704
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:34,309
I don't believe this.

705
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:37,763
The cameras are
really turned on.
It's psychological.

706
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:40,019
You don't give
a shit, do ya?

707
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,602
It's disgraceful.

708
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:48,532
So is you eating it.

709
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:17,724
Hey.

710
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:19,897
You look nice.

711
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,143
Thanks.

712
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:22,395
Can I take
your coat?

713
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:24,143
Yeah.

714
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:30,365
Thank you.

715
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:32,158
Have a seat.

716
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:00,058
You've gone quiet.

717
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:03,015
I like
listening to you.

718
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:28,590
Everything all right?

719
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:30,542
There's got to be
an easier way to do this.

720
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,343
Fuck, Brant.

721
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:34,547
So how does it feel
to actually need
us girls...

722
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:39,017
for more
than just cooking
and cleaning and shagging?

723
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:43,814
I was sorting a way
of listing all Weiss'
arresting officers.

724
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:47,109
I've seemed to pull up
the first one. It's
WPC Sandra Bates.

725
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:50,779
You're kidding.

726
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:57,823
I've had
a really nice time.

727
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:59,246
Yeah.

728
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:06,328
I'll call you.

729
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:13,051
When?

730
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:16,630
When are you
gonna call me?

731
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:18,511
Tomorrow.

732
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:20,433
I'll tell you what.
How about this summer...

733
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:23,224
we'll do a picnic?

734
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:27,354
Don't you think
I know how this goes?

735
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,435
Man says,
"I'll call you"...

736
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:31,732
and a woman's waiting
and hoping.

737
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,905
She's a slave
to her mobile...

738
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:36,654
while he's thinking,
"Well, I'll call her...

739
00:57:36,745 --> 00:57:41,660
tomorrow, some day,
Monday. Doesn't matter.
Well, here's a hint, yeah?

740
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:44,708
It matters.
It matters a lot.

741
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,831
Tomorrow. I'll
call you tomorrow.

742
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:48,378
No, fuck off.

743
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:49,371
Hey!

744
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:01,842
Jesus. Look who else.

745
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:17,529
Fuck. That's Roberts.

746
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:18,904
And Falls.

747
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:23,493
Shit. How could l
be that stupid?

748
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:27,667
Send an armed response
unit round to her flat
straight away.

749
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,119
It's a 19.

750
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:31,580
Come on, Falls.
We're coming.

751
00:58:31,675 --> 00:58:34,132
Oh.

752
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,925
Oh, shit.

753
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:40,222
I'm stupid.
I'm stupid.

754
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,059
What the fuck?

755
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:53,234
What the fuck?

756
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:57,690
Ugh!

757
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,825
Not--

758
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:49,662
Doctors have given her
a sedative. She should
be out for a while.

759
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:51,584
Did she get a look
at the attacker?

760
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:54,208
All she could say for sure
is that he's big and white.

761
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:56,130
Big and white.

762
00:59:56,218 --> 00:59:59,335
So it's not
the black kid
from Different Strokes.

763
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:02,592
It's Barry Weiss.
I know him.

764
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:05,139
Should you be
taking her booze?

765
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:07,309
Well, she
won't notice.

766
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:08,635
Want one?

767
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,595
Yeah.

768
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:15,859
Is she all right?

769
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,902
Who are you?

770
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:19,650
DI Craig Stokes.

771
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:21,280
I heard someone
got killed.

772
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:22,904
It's not Falls.

773
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,575
Cop killer
took a run at her.

774
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:26,324
Some kid jumped in,
a hoodie.

775
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:29,247
He got his ticket punched.

776
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:31,541
Were you
with Falls this evening?

777
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:35,371
Yes. We went
for a drink and
I dropped her off.

778
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:37,293
You dropped her
in it, you mean.

779
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:41,676
Did it not occur
to you to walk her
to the door?

780
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:44,596
What agent.

781
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,936
Taxi!

782
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:56,562
Can you take me
to Bayswater?

783
01:00:57,946 --> 01:00:59,356
It's gonna
cost you, mate.

784
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:00,903
Hey, Bronski Beat.

785
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:02,731
Do I look like
the kind of cunt...

786
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:05,317
who thinks
Bayswater is just
around the corner?

787
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:15,790
Hey, stop here.
Stop here, mate.

788
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:18,588
There. Dean Court.

789
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:23,718
All right.

790
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:24,965
Yeah, all right.

791
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:26,546
There you go.
Keep it.

792
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:35,393
1,000 pounds.

793
01:01:35,567 --> 01:01:40,607
And question two.
We wanted to know the
post code for BIair Castle.

794
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:43,154
Don't know how many
of you ever visited
Blair Castle.

795
01:01:57,214 --> 01:01:59,330
Is he dead?

796
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:02,791
What, the little skinhead?

797
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:06,299
It was a doornail.

798
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:21,150
What's the story
with you and him?

799
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:25,356
Him risking
his life for ya.

800
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:29,284
Oh, I've known him
since he was twelve.

801
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:33,865
He used to live
next door.

802
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,585
When I came out of rehab,
he was the only one around
here I wanted to know.

803
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:43,086
He made me tea.

804
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:45,337
I don't know.
I thought...

805
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,669
I could help him.

806
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:52,224
Oh, my God.

807
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:57,767
Brant.

808
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:31,763
He definitely
did a bunk.

809
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:33,386
Find anything?

810
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:36,225
Nothing incriminating, no.

811
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:40,347
Used to be
a good looking boy.
He let himself go a bit.

812
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,434
Let's go public
with Weiss.

813
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:46,061
Your call.

814
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:48,863
At least we'll flush
the fucker out.

815
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:54,744
[Man over TV}
Police today released
a picture of the suspect...

816
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:57,368
they would like to question
regarding The Blitz.

817
01:03:57,459 --> 01:03:59,916
Yeah! I know him!

818
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:03,336
I dropped the guy off.
He was fucking psycho.

819
01:04:14,309 --> 01:04:15,845
Long time, no see.

820
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:17,220
Hey.

821
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:20,145
Jack, this is
Detective Brant.

822
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:21,346
Hello, mate.

823
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:22,601
Where's our boy?

824
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:24,273
Room 7.

825
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:34,655
Go, go, go.

826
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:44,539
Fuck!

827
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:46,997
He's on the move.

828
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:48,707
Let's go.

829
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:31,215
Ugh.

830
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:34,970
We have him on the Great
Western Road.

831
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:38,511
Head down to Harrow Road.
We 'Il put him off
at the underpass.

832
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:15,711
Now running west
on the Westway.

833
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:26,684
Heading towards Paddington.

834
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:35,067
Suspect entering
train depot...

835
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:37,240
north of Paddington.
Brant still in pursuit.

836
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:40,405
All units
head for train depot...

837
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:42,449
north of Paddington.

838
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:46,158
Do not let B rant engage.
Repeat. Do not let
Brant engage.

839
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:47,518
What the fuck--
[thump}

840
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:49,391
Leave it, Brant.

841
01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:51,856
Brant, calm down.
We've got him.

842
01:07:51,943 --> 01:07:53,228
Get the fuck--

843
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:55,184
Fuck!

844
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,362
Get this piece
of shit out of here.

845
01:07:57,448 --> 01:07:58,813
Just calm down.
Calm down.

846
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:00,899
Move! Now!

847
01:08:00,994 --> 01:08:02,575
We've got him.

848
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:05,077
We've got
him, okay?
We've got him.

849
01:08:15,717 --> 01:08:18,379
The Metropolitan Police
have just confirmed...

850
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:21,594
the arrest of Barry
Weiss, the prime suspect
in The Blitz killings...

851
01:08:21,723 --> 01:08:25,136
in which three London Police
officers were murdered
in cold blood...

852
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:28,093
after a dramatic chase
through West London--

853
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:32,100
A t the Paddington
train depot.

854
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:35,058
Police are refusing
to comment any further--

855
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:46,285
Just selling
records, yeah?

856
01:09:29,082 --> 01:09:31,573
We're going
to record this.
Okay, Barry?

857
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:43,301
I want a lawyer
and a sandwich.

858
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:47,848
Oh, and I want to update
my Facebook status.

859
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:49,890
You have exactly
forty-eight hours.

860
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:53,845
In that time,
you either charge
my client or release him.

861
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:06,317
And he'd like
a different sandwich.
He says the bread is stale.

862
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:09,244
Weiss might be crazy
but he's not stupid.

863
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:11,366
He's covered
his tracks.

864
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:14,415
The fire at Roberts'
flat destroyed any
forensic evidence...

865
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:17,369
we might have had.
Even the Peacock
Gym link is tenuous.

866
01:10:17,422 --> 01:10:19,959
Well, he's admitted
the Jag belongs to him.

867
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:22,290
It's been
sitting in a car park
for at least six months.

868
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:25,172
Anyone could've
had access to it.
There's no CCTT.

869
01:10:25,263 --> 01:10:29,882
I got ahold of the guy
with the dogs, the one that
saw the first murder.

870
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:32,888
Now he's saying he can't
make a positive I D.

871
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:36,387
All right, de 's too scared.
Same goes for the barman
at the Wellesley.

872
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:38,185
You didn't find
anything at the hotel?

873
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:39,356
Nothing.

874
01:10:39,444 --> 01:10:40,809
What about Forensics?

875
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:43,228
Team stripped
it down, but no.

876
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:45,779
With what we've got,
he'll be out tomorrow
laughing his head off.

877
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:47,403
We need something solid.

878
01:10:47,535 --> 01:10:49,617
We'd better come up
with something quick.

879
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:52,950
Otherwise, the killer
is gonna hop, skip
and jump out of here.

880
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,747
The only thing he's getting
so far is a caution.

881
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:20,897
All right, Babe?

882
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:25,354
Yeah. Yeah, no. I've been
away, but...

883
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:27,734
I'm back now.

884
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:30,316
Do you want to come
to my party?

885
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:34,700
Yeah, like old times.

886
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:37,749
Can you take care
of me?

887
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:39,746
Sweet.

888
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:45,418
What's this?

889
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:48,258
Moonshine.
Irish moonshine.

890
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:49,756
Isn't this
stuff illegal?

891
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:52,054
I fucking hope so.

892
01:11:52,099 --> 01:11:54,590
You drink this poison
and then you wonder
why you get blackouts.

893
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:57,347
I drink this poison
because I get blackouts.

894
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:58,644
Sláinte.

895
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:00,096
Cheers.

896
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:09,447
Say we
can't prove anything.
Say Barry Weiss walks.

897
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:11,531
Where are you
going with this?

898
01:12:11,619 --> 01:12:14,452
Well, you told
me once before
about some pedophile.

899
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:18,698
You couldn't
get the bastard through
the regular channels, so...

900
01:12:18,793 --> 01:12:21,409
you took him out yourself.

901
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:25,167
I thought you were asleep
when I told you that.

902
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:28,250
I'm not gonna continue
this line of talk.

903
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:31,009
I don't like
where it's going.

904
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:49,396
Been a busy couple
of days for you, Barry.

905
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:53,241
Took a ride in a police car.
Got your picture in the paper.

906
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:57,115
Highlight of your career.

907
01:12:57,206 --> 01:13:00,869
You know, Barry,
if you were smart...

908
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,542
which I know you're not...

909
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:06,416
you'd admit to what you did...

910
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:10,800
because I'm gonna tell
you now, you'll be a lot
safer in here than out there.

911
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:13,549
Were they
friends of yours...

912
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:16,381
those cops
that got killed?

913
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:25,727
You see...

914
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:29,151
I know what this
is about, Barry.

915
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:37,322
What did those lads
ever do to you, Barry?

916
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:41,326
Of course, you knew.
How did you react?

917
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,908
Fuck you, pig.

918
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:47,040
They call that
resisting arrest.

919
01:13:47,131 --> 01:13:49,998
I call it stupid.

920
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,680
I know I embarrassed you.

921
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:03,594
Since then you've stewed...

922
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:07,398
and cooked
and simmered over it.

923
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:14,731
You should've just let it go.

924
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,082
Personally...

925
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:30,289
I didn't remember until
I saw you. Didn't give it
a second thought.

926
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:34,422
It was so insignificant,
I forgot all about it.

927
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:39,263
We sure all laughed when
I played the surveillance
tapes at the station.

928
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:44,219
We all did.
But that stuff's silly.

929
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:50,061
Sergeant Brant
to you.

930
01:14:55,616 --> 01:14:58,107
The point is, Barry...

931
01:14:58,202 --> 01:15:00,944
you're nothing.

932
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:09,373
No one cares.

933
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:12,963
No one gives a fuck.

934
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:18,552
Oh, and another thing.

935
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:22,928
You, The Blitz.

936
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:25,351
What the fuck is that?

937
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:26,529
Don't mean to bomb
you out, bro...

938
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:28,118
but there's some major
shit going down.

939
01:16:28,209 --> 01:16:29,665
I'm listening.

940
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:31,288
A cop's ripped off
a dealer.

941
01:16:31,378 --> 01:16:33,039
What?

942
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:35,212
They're getting
into the products, man.

943
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:37,255
This dealer is like
serious folks.

944
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:41,677
You fuck with him
and he gets difficult,
even with a woman.

945
01:16:41,764 --> 01:16:44,972
Whoa. Whoa.
Back up a second.

946
01:16:45,059 --> 01:16:47,550
A female cop
is ripping off
drug dealers?

947
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:51,012
She a sister, too.

948
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:52,768
This cop
have a name?

949
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:54,769
Yeah. Falls.

950
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:01,697
Brant. It's Stokes.
Listen, I need your help.

951
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:10,372
I think she's inside.

952
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:18,664
You crashed
a party, man.

953
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:22,047
"You crashed
a party?" You
fucking-- Get him out!

954
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:23,594
Come here.

955
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:35,981
Do you like me?
If you like me--

956
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:41,900
Look at this shit.

957
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:47,156
If you like me,
you can throw me a party.

958
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:51,280
What are you doing?
I don't wanna go!

959
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:54,037
Go back.
He's gonna kill me!

960
01:17:54,128 --> 01:17:57,370
He's gonna kill me!
No! He's gonna kill me!

961
01:17:57,506 --> 01:18:00,873
No!

962
01:18:00,968 --> 01:18:02,879
He's gonna kill me!

963
01:18:31,165 --> 01:18:32,621
What are these?

964
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:35,495
Thanks. They’ll
bring you down.

965
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:38,749
The shower did that.

966
01:18:38,839 --> 01:18:42,002
Just take 'em, Falls.

967
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:56,683
I'm messed up,
aren't l?

968
01:18:59,318 --> 01:19:02,310
Even when I was
working undercover...

969
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:04,395
I was a cop
pretending to be a junkie.

970
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:08,115
But really, I'm just a junkie
playing at being a cop.

971
01:19:11,372 --> 01:19:14,956
He's gonna get away
with it, isn't he?

972
01:19:17,294 --> 01:19:20,161
If we can't protect our own,
what good are we, Brant?

973
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:25,962
What good are we?

974
01:19:52,538 --> 01:19:54,620
A lot
of press waiting?

975
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:58,206
Yes, I'm afraid so.
There's quiet a crowd
gathered outside the front.

976
01:19:58,294 --> 01:20:01,377
But we can leave
through a different
exit, if you prefer.

977
01:20:01,422 --> 01:20:03,037
Fuck no!

978
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:05,839
I hope it's all there.

979
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:21,730
Is something
on your mind, Barry?

980
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:26,060
Well, I guess I'll
see you another day.

981
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:28,237
I can't wait.

982
01:21:01,357 --> 01:21:04,849
Don't worry. We're
having him tailed
around the clock.

983
01:21:04,902 --> 01:21:06,767
Keep him
out of trouble.

984
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:31,083
We're in position now.
He's going into his flat.

985
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:57,158
Is Brant still here?

986
01:21:57,246 --> 01:21:59,077
No. No, he left.

987
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:01,246
It's Roberts' funeral
this afternoon.

988
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:03,870
Every cop in the Southeast
is gonna be there.

989
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:05,792
Except you.

990
01:22:34,575 --> 01:22:37,817
In company with Christ
who died and now lives...

991
01:22:37,911 --> 01:22:39,742
may the rejoicing
in Your Kingdom...

992
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:42,572
where all our tears
are wiped away...

993
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:46,158
unite us together again
in one family...

994
01:22:46,253 --> 01:22:48,790
to sing Your praise
forever and ever.

995
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:50,917
Amen.

996
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:58,841
Eternal rest grant
unto him, Oh, Lord...

997
01:22:58,932 --> 01:23:02,925
and let perpetual light
shine upon him.

998
01:23:06,607 --> 01:23:09,644
Into Your hand,
Father of Mercy...

999
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:13,728
we commend our brother
in sure and certain hope...

1000
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:16,317
that together, all who
have died in Christ...

1001
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:19,525
will live with Him one day.

1002
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:23,238
In nomine Patris,
Filii et Spiritu
Sancti. Amen.

1003
01:23:32,925 --> 01:23:36,884
Beloved Bruce Roberts,
we give your body
to the earth.

1004
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:39,552
Earth Mother,
Root Mother...

1005
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,676
Father of soil.

1006
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:46,261
We give You this body
of our beloved Bruce Roberts.

1007
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:49,142
His eyes will never
greet us again.

1008
01:23:49,233 --> 01:23:51,349
Return to earth.

1009
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:54,150
We will not kiss these lops.

1010
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:56,229
Return to earth.

1011
01:24:06,959 --> 01:24:09,621
What he has been is gone.

1012
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:12,418
What he is now
has passed the gate...

1013
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:16,081
leaving his body
to become soil.

1014
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:18,667
This flesh
to nurture flowers...

1015
01:24:18,762 --> 01:24:22,675
these bones
to be roots of trees.

1016
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:17,233
Come on.

1017
01:25:48,769 --> 01:25:51,226
Yeah, what's the latest?

1018
01:25:51,313 --> 01:25:53,725
Weiss hasn't left
his flat all day.

1019
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:02,320
Fuck.

1020
01:28:04,988 --> 01:28:08,196
Brant! Turn around,
you fucker!

1021
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:10,899
I wanna see your face
as your head explodes.

1022
01:28:18,418 --> 01:28:20,659
Ugh. Agh.

1023
01:28:25,425 --> 01:28:28,633
What? You think
you fooled me?

1024
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:33,384
No chance. I was
just playing along.

1025
01:28:33,517 --> 01:28:34,677
Ugh!

1026
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:41,805
Ugh!

1027
01:28:48,365 --> 01:28:50,356
Come on, Barry.

1028
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:51,986
What are you
gonna do?

1029
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:57,617
Huh? Call
the cops?

1030
01:29:10,136 --> 01:29:14,004
You stupid fucking pig.

1031
01:29:14,099 --> 01:29:17,762
Wait till the papers
get a load of this, hey.

1032
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:19,844
I'm gonna sue you.

1033
01:29:19,938 --> 01:29:21,303
And you.

1034
01:29:21,398 --> 01:29:24,890
And all of you
fucking pig cunts.

1035
01:29:24,985 --> 01:29:28,352
I'm gonna make
fucking millions.

1036
01:29:31,116 --> 01:29:32,856
You fucking--

1037
01:29:32,951 --> 01:29:34,612
Brant?

1038
01:29:38,915 --> 01:29:40,997
You fuck.

1039
01:29:41,084 --> 01:29:43,416
You can't kill me.

1040
01:29:43,545 --> 01:29:46,332
I'm The Blitz.

1041
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:49,043
Are you talking
about that cop killer?

1042
01:29:49,134 --> 01:29:52,046
That can't be you, Barry.

1043
01:29:52,137 --> 01:29:55,550
We tried to convict you
but you were innocent.

1044
01:29:55,682 --> 01:29:59,846
The only thing we do know
is he was partial to
people in uniform...

1045
01:29:59,936 --> 01:30:02,678
just like the one
you're wearing.

1046
01:30:02,772 --> 01:30:06,640
And he used a weapon
just like this one.

1047
01:30:33,762 --> 01:30:36,799
Fucking lucky
he didn't shoot
me in the head.

1048
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:54,317
Something tells me
this one's gonna
remain unsolved.

1049
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:01,820
You're not supposed
to smoke in here.

1050
01:31:01,915 --> 01:31:04,031
What you gonna do?

1051
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:05,831
Shoot me?

1052
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:11,998
I'm just leaving
the office now, darling.

1053
01:31:12,092 --> 01:31:14,834
Yeah, I'll be back at 7:00.
I love you too, Amanda. Yeah.

1054
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:19,212
There he is.
There's Brecky.

1055
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:20,342
Fuck.

1056
01:31:20,433 --> 01:31:22,048
Bon appétit.

1057
01:31:24,938 --> 01:31:26,849
Get out! Get away!

1058
